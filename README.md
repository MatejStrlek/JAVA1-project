Movie Management Application


This repository contains a Java application for managing movie-related data, including movies, actors, directors, and more. The application stores data in a Microsoft SQL Server database and offers features such as user authentication, role-based access control, CRUD operations on entities, RSS parsing for data updates, and image management.

User Roles: The application supports two roles, Administrator and User.
Authentication: Users can log in using a secure login form, and new users can register as Users.
Administrator Functionality: Administrators can delete all data from the database and upload new data using an RSS parser.
RSS Parsing: The RSS parser fetches data from specified URLs, saves it to the database, and downloads images to a local directory.
CRUD Operations: Users can view and update entities (e.g., Movies, Actors, Directors) using organized forms.
Data Consistency: The application ensures consistent image management when entities are updated or deleted.
UI Organization: Forms are well-organized using components like JTabbedPane and JMenu.
Table-Based Display: JTable and AbstractTableModel are utilized for displaying entities.
Drag and Drop: Drag and drop functionality is implemented for certain entity associations.
XML Download: Data can be downloaded as XML using the JAXB library.
